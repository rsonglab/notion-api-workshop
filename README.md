## About the Workshop

In this workshop, we will walk through how to work with a Notion database using the API.

### Creating new pages

First using some JSON from Twitter, we'll add new feedback to the database.

### Getting a database schema

Then we'll get the database's "tags" from its schema.

### Querying a database

Then we'll query the database for feedback and match them with tags.

### Updating pages

Finally, we'll update the pages in the database by adding tags to them.
